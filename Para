paragraph is a distinct section of text that addresses a single topic or idea, composed of multiple related sentences, and typically begins with an indentation or a new line. It functions as a building block for organizing prose, containing a topic sentence that introduces the main point, supporting details or examples, and a concluding sentence that summarizes or transitions to the next idea.
